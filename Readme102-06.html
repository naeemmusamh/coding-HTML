        Introducing CSS
    </h1>
    <p>
        Understanding CSS: Thinking Inside the Box The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. On this page, you can see a basic HTML page. On the right hand page, you can see the same HTML page,
        but I have added outlines to each of the elements so that you can see how CSS will treat each element as if it lives inside its own box.

    <h2>
        BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include the h1-h6, p and div elements. Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include b, i, img, em and span. CSS allows you to create rules that
            control the way that each individual box and the contents of that box is presented. In this example, block level elements are shown with red borders, and inline elements have green borders. The body element creates the first box, then the
            h1, h2, p, i, and a elements each create their own boxes within it. Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text inside a box â€” for example,
            its color, size, and the typeface used.
