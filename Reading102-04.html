        JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        so you need to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS. Beyond that. no prior experience with programming is necessary. Learning to program with JavaScript involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1- Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.
        </li>
        <li>
            2- Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
            3- Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        javascript allows you to make pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser. how javascript makes web pages more interactive:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1- ACCESS CONTENT You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
        </li>
        <li>
            Select the text inside all of the (hl) elements on a page.
            <li>
                Select any elements that have ac 1 ass attribute with a value of note.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                2- MODIFY CONTENT You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a paragraph of text after the first (hl) element
            </li>
            <li>
                Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
            </li>
            <li>
                Change the size or position of an (i mg) element
            </li>
            <li>
                3- PROGRAM RULES You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
            </li>
            <li>
                A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
            </li>
            <li>
                A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
            </li>
            <li>
                An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).
            </li>
            <li>
                4- REACT TO EVENTS You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
            </li>
            <li>
                A button is pressed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A link is clicked (or tapped) on.
            </li>
            <li>
                A cursor hovers over an element.
            </li>
            <li>
                Information is added to a form.
            </li>
            <li>
                An interval of time has passed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A web page has finished loading.
            </li>
            <h4>
                javascript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. it can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:
            </p>
            <p>
                1- Access the content of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                2- Modify the content of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                3- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                4- React to events triggered by the user or browser.
            </p>

            <h4>

                a limited amount of space.

            <p>Each version of a web browser adds new features. Often these new features make tasks easier, or are considered better, than using older techniques. But, website visitors do not always keep up with the latest browser releases, so website developers
                cannot always rely upon the latest technologies. As you will see, there are many inconsistencies between browsers that affect JavaScript developers. jQuery will help you deal with cross-browser inconsistencies (it is one of the major reasons
                why jQuery rapidly gained popularity amongst web developers). But, before you learn jQuery, it helps to know what it is helping you to achieve.</p>
            <h4>A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:</h4>
            <p>RECIPES By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before. Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish.
                Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.</p>
            <p>HANDBOOKS Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to follow in certain situations.
            </p>
            <p>MANUALS Mechanics often refer to car repair manuals when servicing models they are not familiar with. These manuals contain a series of tests to check the key functions of the car are working, along with details of how to fix any issues that
                arise.
            </p>
            <p>WRITING A SCRIPT To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking about them too much, for example, you might be
                able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email without a set of detailed instructions. But the first time we do these things they can seem daunting. Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break it down into smaller tasks
                and learn one of these at a time. With experience, these individual tasks grow familiar and seem simpler. Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing when you have finished this book will be quite complicated and might look intimidating
                at first. However, a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem at hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a computer to solve a puzzle
                one step at a time.</p>
            <h2>RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES</h2>
            <p>Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:</p>
            <p>
                1- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
            </p>
            <p>
                2- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
            </p>
            <p>
                3- You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. ONLINE
                EXTRA View a full list of keywords and reserved words in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                4- All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                5- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, last Name for their last name, and age for their age.
            </p>
            <p>
                6- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f I rename rather than a first name (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore
                between each word (you cannot use a dash).</li>
        </p>
        <h5>var colors;colors= ('white', 'black', ' custom ');</h5>
        <p>ARRAYS An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. Arrays are especially
            helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. If you don't know how many items a list will contain, rather than creating enough
            variables for a long list (when you might only use a small percentage of them), using an array is considered a better solution. For example, an array can be suited to storing the individual items on a shopping list because it is a list of
            related items.</p>
        <p>CREATING AN ARRAY You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array). The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is
            separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number, and a Boolean all in the same array.</p>
        <h5>var colors;colors= ('white', 'black', ' custom ');</h5>
        <p>VALUES IN ARRAYS Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY Each item in an array is automatically given a number
            called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array.</p>
        <h5>var colors;colors= ['white ' ,'black ' ,' custom'];</h5>
        <p>INDEX VALUE</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>o</th>
                <th>1</th>
                <th>2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>'white'</td>
                <td>'black'</td>
                <td>'custom'</td>
        </table>
        <h2>An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
        </h2>
        <p>
            1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).
        </p>
        <h5>var color = 'beige';</h5>
        <p>
            The value of co 1 or is now beige. When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically, undefined is a data type like a number, string, or Boolean.
        </p>
        <p>
            2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. For example:
            <h5>var area = 3 * 2;</h5>
            The value of area is now 6. Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. This example also uses the assignment operator, so the result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable called area. Another example where an expression uses two values to
            yield a single value would be where two strings are joined to create a single string.
